      <h1>Hey there! I'm Olavo, a software engineer based in <span>SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil</span>.</h1>
      <p>I'm interested in dev rel, design systems, user/dev experience and software architecture. With 7+ years of experience in different roles from product design to management working for companies ranging from small startups to big corps I decided to reinvent myself.</p>
      <p>I'm currently reskilling myself as a Software Engineer. You can check my self designed 'bootcamp' here.</p>
      <p>Previously, I worked at Axur, where I as a product manager focused on Data Leakage products. Before that, I worked for b8one and few other companies.</p>
